# Presentation {#apps}

Today exists a lot of web-based ressources to manage radiocarbon dates, but [few solutions](#c14.app) exist for their **interactive selection and spatialization**, NeoNet app and EUROEVOL_R app have been developped for this purpose. These interactive web form map-based allow the selection of radiocarbon dates by: 

* a geographical region of interest (ROI)
* a time span between a *tpq* and a *taq* in cal BC
* some periods (Late Mesolithic, Early Neolithic, etc.)
* the quality of the date (live duration, maximum accepted SD)

The apps offer also **tools for their analysis** like summing probability densities (SPD) depending on different levels of grouping, starting from the archaeoligical unit (layer, structure, etc.) to the total sum of the selected dates.

The **NeoNet and EUROEVOL_R apps** have been developped with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language and the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package. They share the same layout, only the datasets are differents. **NeoNet and EUROEVOL_R databases** canvas -- like the columns' names or values' names -- is the one of the EUROEVOL database. 

* **[NeoNet app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/NeoNet/)** covers the Central Mediterranean for the Late Mesolithic and Middle Neolithic (ca. 8,000 - 4,500 BC) with near to 1,000 radiocarbon dates.

</p>

The database, a Google Sheet, is opensource and active (in development), see the [**NeoNet app** webpage](https://zoometh.github.io/C14/neonet/#app)

* **[EUROEVOL_R app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/Euroevol_R/)** covers the Central, Western and Northern Europe from Paleolithic times to the end of Bronze Age (ca. 17,000 - 500 BC) with near to 14,000 radiocarbon dates

The app database is the [EUROEVOL database](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/), is opensource and static (yet developed), see the [**EUROEVOL_R app** webpage](https://zoometh.github.io/C14/euroevol)

# Use **NeoNet** and **EUROEVOL_R** {#app}

The apps are [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) have the same functionalities. The app is divided into 4 panels:

* [**map** panel](#panel.map): ROI with selection menus
* [**calib** panel](#panel.calib): calibration of the selected dates
* [**data** panel](#panel.data): the whole dataset
* [**infos** panel](#panel.infos): credits and other infos

The two main panels are **map** and **calib**


## **map** panel {#panel.map}
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoometh/C14/main/docs/imgs/panel_map_idx.png){width=20%}


The panel **map** is used for selection of radiocarbon dates by location, chronology and material life duration. The geographical interface is provided by the [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package. 

```{r panel.map,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
lwd <- 5
map.group.c14 <- image_draw(panel.map)
# xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop
# Group button
rect(20, 30, 200, 160,
     border = "red", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
# dynamic periods
rect(20, 750, 130, 600,
     border = "orange", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
# slider
rect(150, 720, 800, 650,
     border = "blue", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
# count
rect(400, 780, 600, 740,
     border = "darkgrey", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
# dynamic table
rect(20, 886, 1650, 770,
     border = "green", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
# SDs
rect(1300, 720, 1650, 600,
     border = "purple", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
# button periods
rect(1450, 30, 1650, 550,
     border = "brown", lty = "dashed", lwd = lwd)
invisible(dev.off())
plot(map.group.c14)
```

One of the basemaps of the app is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/37.753/14.524) (OSM). OSM offers a well documented basemap where archaeological sites are sometimes already located, like the Ligurian site of [Grotta della Pollera](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/44.20058/8.31466). Clicking on the NeoNet app map show the lat/long coordinates of the current point (<span style="color:red">red</span> box under the tpq/tap slider). These coordinates can then be copied and used to modify the NeoNet database. 

```{r panel.map.coords.img,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
# par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
# # A tibble: 1 x 7
#   format width height colorspace matte filesize density
#   <chr>  <int>  <int> <chr>      <lgl>    <int> <chr>  
# 1 PNG     1664    886 sRGB       TRUE   1496175 118x118
panel.map.coords.img <- image_draw(panel.map.coords)
# xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop
# Group button
rect(120, 270, 270, 300,
     border = "red", lty = "dashed", lwd = 4)
invisible(dev.off())
plot(panel.map.coords.img)
```

The apps offer a geographical window to select the dates which will be analysed (calibrated, summed, exported, etc.). By definition, only the data within the extent of the window (ROI) will be analysed. In addition, several menus allow to refine the selection. The count of selected dates and sites is dynamically calculated below the [tpq/taq slider](#panel.map.tapq) and above the [table of the selected dates](#panel.map.tab) (<span style="color:darkgrey">grey</span> box). 

### group c14 *button* {#panel.map.grC14}

Top-left button (<span style="color:red">red</span> box), allows to cluster dates by spatial proximities (see [Marker Clusters](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html))

### periods *filter*

Top-right checkboxes (<span style="color:brown">brown</span> box) allow to select datations by periods. A hyperlink on the title of the checkboxes open the [correspondance table](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zoometh/C14/blob/main/period_abrev.html) between abrevations and period full names. Bottom-left legend **periods** (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> box) is a dynamic list of periods which exist in the selected periods (see **periods** checkboxes)

### tpq/taq *filter* {#panel.map.tapq}

bottom-left slider (<span style="color:blue">blue</span> box) allows to subset a range of accepted dates between a *tpq* and a *taq* (in cal BC) 

### radiocarbon quality *filter*

bottom-right checkboxes and slider (<span style="color:purple">purple</span> box) form a group of menus for selection on the material life duration and max accepted SD:

* relatively to the duration of their material (short to long-life material). An hyperlink open the [correspondance table](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zoometh/C14/blob/main/material_life.html) between the classes of the material life duration (short, long, etc.) and their material (wood, shell, etc.) categories  

* below a maximum accepted threshold for the standard deviations (SD) for the dates

### selected dates *table* {#panel.map.tab}

bottom dataframe (<span style="color:green">green</span> box) is a reactive a datatable ([DT package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT/index.html)) listing all the dates within the map extent (ROI) and the selection menus (tpq/taq, material life duration, maximum SD, periods). 

## **calib** panel {#panel.calib}
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoometh/C14/main/docs/imgs/panel_calib_idx.png){width=20%}


The panel **calib** is used for dates on-the-fly calibration with the R packages [Bchron](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Bchron/index.html) and [rcarbon](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcarbon/index.html). Calibrations are done on the whole dataset of dates displayed in the [table of the **map panel**](#panel.map). If the dates are numerous (eg > 100) the computing time could take times.

### c14 group by *filter*

The only selection which can be done is on the top-center radio button  (<span style="color:red">red</span> box). The **c14 group by ...** filter allows to plot dates and to sum their probability densities depending on different levels of grouping:

* **by date**: each date is plot separeltly (by default)

* **by site and layer**: dates from the same site, having the same archaeological unit (layer, structure, etc.), are summed

* **by site and period**: dates from the same site, having the same period are summed

* **by period**: dates having the same period are summed  

* **all C14**: all dates are summed 

```{r panel.calib, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
calib.group.c14 <- image_draw(panel.calib)
# # xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop
# Group button
rect(1400, 0, 1500, 70,
     border = "green", lty = "dashed", lwd = 4)
# download
rect(700, 0, 1300, 70,
     border = "red", lty = "dashed", lwd = 4)
# dynamic periods
rect(20, 80, 1400, 700,
     border = "orange", lty = "dashed", lwd = 4)
invisible(dev.off())
plot(calib.group.c14)
```

### plot area *output*

The plot area (<span style="color:orange">orange</span> box) shows dynamically the SPD of the cabibrated dates seriated on their weighted means. The top-right  button **Download** (<span style="color:green">green</span> box) allows to export the last plot in a PNG image
