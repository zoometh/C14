# Presentation {#apps}

Today exists a lot of web-based ressources for [database](#c14.db) and [calibrate](#c14.cal) radiocarbon dates, but few solutions exist for their [**interactive selection and spatialization**](#c14.app), NeoNet app and EUROEVOL_R app have been developped for this purpose. These interactive web form map-based allow the selection of radiocarbon dates by: 

* a geographical region of interest (ROI)
* a time span between a *tpq* and a *taq* in cal BC
* some periods (Late Mesolithic, Early Neolithic, etc.)
* the quality of the date (live duration, maximum accepted SD)

The apps offer also **tools for their analysis** like summing probability densities (SPD) depending on different levels of grouping, starting from the archaeoligical unit (layer, structure, etc.) to the total sum of the selected dates.

The **NeoNet and EUROEVOL_R apps** have been developped with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language and the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package. They share the same layout, only the datasets are differents. **NeoNet and EUROEVOL_R databases** canvas -- like the columns' names or values' names -- is the one of the EUROEVOL database. 

* **[NeoNet app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/NeoNet/)** covers the Central Mediterranean for the Late Mesolithic and Middle Neolithic (ca. 8,000 - 4,500 BC) with near to 1,000 radiocarbon dates.

</p>

The database, a Google Sheet, is opensource and active (in development), see the [**NeoNet app** webpage](https://zoometh.github.io/C14/neonet/#app)

* **[EUROEVOL_R app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/Euroevol_R/)** covers the Central, Western and Northern Europe from Paleolithic times to the end of Bronze Age (ca. 17,000 - 500 BC) with near to 14,000 radiocarbon dates

The app database is the [EUROEVOL database](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/), is opensource and static (yet developed), see the [**EUROEVOL_R app** webpage](https://zoometh.github.io/C14/euroevol)

# Radiocarbon ressources

Free ressources exist for radiocarbon [apps](c14.app), [databases](#c14.db), [calibrations](#c14.cal) or for [analysis](#c14.analysis)

## applications {#c14.app}


```{r dat.app, echo=FALSE}
c14.app.url <- c("https://theia.arch.cam.ac.uk/MedAfriCarbon/", "https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR", "https://www.ibercrono.org/goget/index.php")
c14.app.names <- c("MedAfriCarbon", "c14bazAAR", "GoGet")
c14.app.df <- data.frame(names=c14.app.names,
                        url=c14.app.url,
                        stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(c14.app.df,"html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size=12)
```


The [MedAfriCarbon](https://theia.arch.cam.ac.uk/MedAfriCarbon/) RShiny app offers additional options for selection and calibration of radiocarbon dates

## databases {#c14.db}

An almost exhaustive inventory of open databases has been made on the [c14bazAAR repository](https://github.com/ropensci/c14bazAAR#databases)

```{r dat.db, echo=FALSE}
c14.db.url <- c("http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811","https://radon.ufg.uni-kiel.de/","https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk","http://telearchaeology.org/c14-databses/","http://www.britarch.ac.uk/info/c14.html","http://www.14sea.org/2_dates.html","https://www.exoriente.org/associated_projects/ppnd_sites.php","http://www.archeometrie.mom.fr/banadora/")
c14.db.names <- c("EUROEVOL","Radon","ORAU","telearchaeology","Archaeological Site Index to Radiocarbon Dates from Great Britain and Ireland","14SEA Project","EX ORIENTE","BANADORA")
c14.db.df <- data.frame(names=c14.db.names,
                        url=c14.db.url,
                        stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(c14.db.df,"html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size=12)
```

## calibrations {#c14.cal}

```{r dat.calib, echo=FALSE}
c14.calib.app <- c("dedicated","dedicated","dedicated","R programming", "R programming","R programming")
c14.calib.url <- c("https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal/",
                   "http://www.calpal-online.de/",
                   "http://calib.org/calib/",
                   "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcarbon/index.html",
                   "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Bchron/index.html",
                   "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oxcAAR/index.html")
c14.calib.names <- c("OxCal","CalPal","Calib","rcarbon","Bchron","oxcAAR")
c14.calib.df <- data.frame(type=c14.calib.app,
                           names=c14.calib.names,
                           url=c14.calib.url,
                           stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(c14.calib.df,"html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size=12)
```

## analysis {#c14.analysis}

R offers a comprehensive framework to calibrate, plot, sum and use temporal constraints -- stratigraphy, periodisations, etc., like bayesian analysis -- on radiocarbon datasets. 
Free software offering a dedicated solution for bayesian inference are: [ChronoModel](https://chronomodel.com/), [OpenBUGS](http://www.openbugs.net/w/FrontPage), [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/), etc.

For a overview of the available solutions, see the [R Bayesian task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html)
