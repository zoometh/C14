### Radiocarbon and dendrochronological data integration and visualization

Radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) and dendrochronological dates are one of the most sharable world-wide data. Their integration in online database, their management, and their modeling represent a classic playground in computing archaeology. R programming offers different tools to manage these data, we present a [short interactive review](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/C14dated_review/) of R based computer solutions

### **NeoNet** Neolithisation of the central and western Mediterranean
> by Thomas Huet and [Niccolo Mazzuco](nicco.mazzucco@gmail.com)

We started to developp a RShiny app for interactive selection, mapping and calibration for the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition in Central and Western Mediterranean, the [NeoNet app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/NeoNet2/)

The NeoNet webpage explains [how to use](https://zoometh.github.io/C14/neonet) this app. The canvas of this RShiny app allows to use another database: the [Euroevol database](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/), and to create the [EUROEVOL_R app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/Euroevol_R/)
