## Radiocarbon data integration and visualization

Radiocarbon dates (<sup>14</sup>C) are one of the most sharable world-wide data. Their integration in online database, their management, and their modeling represent a classic playground in computing archaeology. R programming offers different tools to manage these data, we present a [short interactive review](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/C14dated_review/) of computer solutions

### NeoNet, Neolithisation of the central and western Mediterranean
> by Thomas Huet and [Niccolo Mazzuco](nicco.mazzucco@gmail.com)

We started to developp a RShiny app for interactive selection, mapping and calibration for the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition in Central and Western Mediterranean, the NeoNet app

The [NeoNet database](https://zoometh.github.io/C14/neonet) is in progress. The canvas of the RShiny app allows to use another database, the [Euroevol database](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/) into the [EUROEVOL_R app](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/Euroevol_R/)
